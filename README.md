## Introduction
Query Response Generation Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) leverages the power of pre-trained language models and external knowledge sources to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries. This project aims to combine retrieval-based methods with generative models to enhance the quality and relevance of generated responses.

## Features
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines retrieval and generation for enhanced responses.
- **Scalable**: Handles large datasets and extensive knowledge bases.
- **Customizable**: Easily configurable to adapt to different domains and datasets.
- **Interactive**: Provides a simple interface for querying and getting responses.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/query-response-rag.git
    cd query-response-rag
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your dataset and knowledge base. Ensure it is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

2. **Configuration**: Modify the `config.yaml` file to include paths to your dataset and any other configuration settings.

3. **Run the Application**: Start the application to process queries:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Interactive Querying**: Use the interactive querying interface to get responses:
    ```sh
    python query_interface.py
    ```
